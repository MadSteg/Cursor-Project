# GitHub Push Guide for Cursor IDE Migration

## Current Repository Status
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/MadSteg/BlockReceiptNEW
- **Current Branch**: main
- **Git User**: MadSteg (steven.donoghue@icloud.com)
- **Latest Commit**: "Prepare project for transfer to Cursor IDE with comprehensive export packages"

## Safe Push Strategy

### Current Issue: Git Conflicts Detected
Your local repository has diverged from GitHub (263 local commits vs 1 remote commit). Here's the safe approach:

### Step 1: Manual GitHub Update (Recommended)
Since there are git conflicts, I recommend manually updating your GitHub repository:

1. **Create a fresh repository branch** or **create a new repository** for the Cursor-ready version
2. **Upload files directly** through GitHub's web interface
3. This ensures no regression and gives you a clean migration path

### Step 2: Alternative - Force Push (Use with Caution)
If you want to overwrite the GitHub repository with your current version:

```bash
# First, resolve the git lock issue
rm -f .git/index.lock

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit current state
git commit -m "Final banking-compliant version ready for Cursor IDE migration"

# Force push to overwrite remote (CAUTION: This overwrites GitHub history)
git push origin main --force
```

### Step 3: Recommended Approach - New Branch
Create a new branch for the Cursor migration:

```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b cursor-migration-v1

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Banking compliant version for Cursor IDE"

# Push new branch
git push origin cursor-migration-v1
```

### Step 4: Manual File Upload Method (Safest)
1. Go to https://github.com/MadSteg/BlockReceiptNEW
2. Create a new branch called `cursor-ready`
3. Upload key directories: `client/`, `server/`, `shared/`, `package.json`, etc.
4. Cursor can then clone this specific branch

## For Cursor IDE Setup

### 1. Clone Repository in Cursor
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MadSteg/BlockReceiptNEW.git

```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys to .env
```

### 4. Database Setup

npm run db:push
```

### 5. Start Development
