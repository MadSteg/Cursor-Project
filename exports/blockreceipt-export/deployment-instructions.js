==========================================
BLOCKRECEIPT.AI SMART CONTRACT DEPLOYMENT
==========================================

CURRENT ISSUE:
The application is currently using your wallet address as if it were a smart contract address.
Your wallet address (${process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY ? 'hidden for security' : 'undefined'}) 
cannot be used as a contract address. We need to deploy the actual ERC-1155 contract.

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
1. PREPARE THE CONTRACT:
   The Receipt1155.sol contract is ready in the contracts directory.

2. DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:
   a) Use Remix IDE (Easiest):
      - Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/
      - Create a new file named Receipt1155.sol
      - Copy the content from ./contracts/Receipt1155.sol 
      - Compile the contract
      - Go to the Deploy tab
      - Select "Injected Web3" as environment (connect to MetaMask)
      - Select Polygon Amoy network in MetaMask (ChainID: 80002)
      - Deploy the contract, passing your wallet address as initialOwner
      - Copy the deployed contract address

   b) Use Hardhat (For developers):
      - Fix module compatibility issues in hardhat config
      - Run "npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-amoy-updated.js --config hardhat.amoy.config.cjs"
      - Copy the deployed contract address

3. UPDATE ENVIRONMENT:
   - Update your .env file:
     RECEIPT_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<deployed-contract-address>
     RECEIPT_MINTER_ADDRESS=<deployed-contract-address>

4. RESTART APPLICATION:
   - Restart your server to use the new contract address

5. VERIFY CONTRACT (Optional):
   - Verify the contract on Polygon Amoy block explorer for transparency

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- You MUST use an actual deployed contract address, not your wallet address
- The contract must have the mintReceipt, getReceiptHash, and verifyReceiptHash functions
- Ensure your wallet has enough MATIC for deployment gas fees

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
After successfully deploying the contract and updating your environment:
1. The system will interact with your actual smart contract instead of your wallet
2. Receipt minting will work correctly
3. Verification of receipts will function properly
