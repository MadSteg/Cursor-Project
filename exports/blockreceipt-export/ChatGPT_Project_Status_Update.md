# BlockReceipt.ai - Current Project Status

## Executive Summary
BlockReceipt.ai has evolved from a basic NFT receipt platform into a sophisticated consent-based customer engagement platform. We've successfully pivoted from traditional cross-merchant loyalty to a privacy-first model where customers control their purchase data and brands pay for verified, consented access to real purchaser insights.
