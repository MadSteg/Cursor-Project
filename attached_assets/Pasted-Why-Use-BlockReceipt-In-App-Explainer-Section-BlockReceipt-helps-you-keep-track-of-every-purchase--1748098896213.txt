Why Use BlockReceipt – In-App Explainer Section
BlockReceipt helps you keep track of every purchase — securely, privately, and permanently — without relying on paper, email, or memory. Here’s why it’s better than traditional receipts, and how it works seamlessly with your shopping experience.

Your Receipts, Upgraded
No more lost paper or endless inbox searches. BlockReceipts are:

- Minted automatically after purchase (no setup required)

- Stored in a secure, searchable digital vault

- Available anytime via mobile

It’s your receipt history reimagined — modern, accessible, and reliable.

Return with Confidence
Show proof of purchase in seconds — even months later. BlockReceipts:

- Can’t fade or be lost

- Help you return or exchange faster

- Are cryptographically verifiable

No more digging through drawers. Just open your receipt vault.

Track Your Spending Smarter
BlockReceipt uses OCR to scan and categorize what you’ve bought. Over time, you get:

- Insights into spending habits

- Reorder suggestions

- Purchase summaries by store, category, or item

Think of it as a smart ledger that builds itself.

Eco-Friendly by Design
Paper receipts are wasteful — and most thermal paper can’t be recycled.

BlockReceipt:

- Helps reduce paper use

- Lowers carbon footprint

- Powers more sustainable commerce

It’s better for you and the planet.

Fully Private & Secure
Receipts are stored using encryption and privacy-preserving technology like Threshold PRE.

Only you control your data.

You can choose to share data with vendors — but only if it benefits you.

No Wallet? No Problem.
When you use BlockReceipt, we create a secure digital vault for you behind the scenes.

You don’t need:

- A crypto wallet

- Seed phrases

- Technical knowledge

Just pay as usual, and we’ll mint your receipt quietly and automatically.

Looks Good, Too.
Some receipts come with limited-edition designs, animations, or loyalty perks — turning everyday purchases into collectible experiences.

Still Want Paper? You Can.
BlockReceipt is an option, not a replacement. You can still print or email if you want. We’re just giving you a better one.

BlockReceipt is the smart, secure, eco-friendly way to own your purchase history.

No apps to learn. No settings to configure. Just receipts — finally done right.

Now available anywhere you see “Mint BlockReceipt” at checkout.
