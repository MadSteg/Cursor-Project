Brand the app with the following essence:
BlockReceipt is a visionary, privacy-first, Web3-native alternative to the world’s clunky, paper-based receipt ecosystem — stress that it’s completely aligned with where consumer tech is heading.  
🧠 What You’re Really Building

BlockReceipt.ai is not just an NFT app — it’s a new receipt protocol. It:
•	Replaces email receipts with wallet-based, encrypted NFT receipts (no PII leakage)
•	Offers a retroactive upload system for people with paper receipts, enabling:
o	Personal inventory tracking
o	Proof-of-purchase storage
o	Optional resale/warranty access
•	Costs less for merchants than thermal paper + delivery + storage
•	Offers unique, low-cost NFT visuals using AI art generation (e.g., cats/dogs) that are:
o	Cheap ($0.01 mint cost)
o	Unique (even 1-pixel differences)
o	Tied to the transaction tier
 
🔥 Strategic Insights

🎯 1. 
Post-sale Receipt Uploads = Inventory Management Trojan Horse
•	You position BlockReceipt as not just a replacement, but an enhancement:
o	Users can search, sort, tag purchases
o	Export for taxes, returns, expense reports
o	Have fun building their own digital “ledger” or visual history

🧾 2. 
No Email = More Privacy, Less Spam
•	The receipt lives on-chain, not in a Gmail inbox
•	A smart contract + wallet = zero-data marketing, fully permissionless

💰 3. 
AI + Low-Cost NFT Minting = Scalability
•	You can generate dynamic, low-cost visuals per receipt tier:
o	For <$10, use ultra-low-cost generative cats/dogs, $0.005–$0.01 each
o	For $10–$50, add colors/filters
o	For $100+, upgrade style, animation, or badge
•	Use a basic AI generator on-device or in-browser to lower server costs
•	Store image hash in metadata to prove uniqueness, even if minor
 
🧱 Replit Development Prompt (High Signal, Ready to Paste)

I want BlockReceipt.ai to offer a privacy-first alternative to email receipts. Instead of asking for emails at checkout, merchants or users upload the receipt (e.g., a CVS slip for $12.20 for shampoo + Twix). The system extracts receipt data via OCR, classifies the spend, and issues a low-cost NFT that acts as a permanent receipt.

Key rules:
•	If purchase is <$10: generate a low-cost NFT (~$0.01) using AI art (simple dog/cat variation)
•	All NFTs must be unique, even if visually basic (pixel changes, hash tweaks, filters)
•	The NFT is minted to the user’s connected wallet, without using email
•	Receipt metadata is encrypted using Threshold TACo — only the original wallet can view purchase details

We must also:
•	Build a UI where users can upload a photo of a physical receipt and receive an NFT in return
•	Display all receipts in a visual ledger UI (sortable by date, merchant, amount, etc.)
•	Offer optional “analytics” on spend over time (like Mint or Personal Capital)
•	Ensure NFTs are marketplace-compatible, but only show public art + tier — not encrypted purchase data

Bonus (if possible): support direct drag/drop receipt images and trigger on-device preview + tier estimation before minting.
